8. Requested to improve code coverage, focusing only on .ts files.
9. Asked to check why coverage directory is not ignored in git, and to fix it.
10. Ran git rm -r --cached coverage to remove coverage from git tracking.
11. Requested a summary git commit message for all changes made.
12. Requested a file to record all commands, changes, and visual statistics.
