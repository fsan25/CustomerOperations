5. Refactored test and server structure to avoid port conflicts and improve test isolation.
6. Investigated and fixed issues with Jest running compiled `.js` test files.
7. Requested and generated a detailed architecture/SOLID report and PlantUML diagram.
8. Iteratively improved the architecture diagram for clarity, color, and legend.
9. Saved and exported the final diagram as PNG, and provided extension recommendations.
10. Requested and received a session summary matching previous AgenticAI logs.
